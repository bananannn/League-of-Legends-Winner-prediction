# League-of-Legends-Winner-prediction

This project uses the dataset on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/paololol/league-of-legends-ranked-matches
By using six machine learning models, such as random forest and KLP classifier, it can predict whether a player will win or lose a game.

# Models used
Multi-Layer Perceptron

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Gredient Boosting Decision Tree

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine

# Package Used

The plots are generated by Bokeh

To install: pip install bokeh

# Result and Discussion
Given those models, the SVM shows the poorest accuracy. Furthermore, SVM requires normalization of data. Otherwise, the result will not converge.
The best model to predict whether a player will win is the model called Multi-Layer Perceptron. Logistic regression is also a promising model to use.

# Conclusion
By preprocessing dataset, one can find many factors become less influencial along with the duration of the game becoming longer. Furthermore, given that the accuracy is around 80%, disadvantaged players should always have 20% chance to win the game.

Thus, my advice is that: never give up.
